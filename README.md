# Divisors

Introduction to integer divisibility, modular arithmetic, and their generalizations. Written with the aim to assume as little pre-existing mathematical knowledge as possible of the reader. Structured by the author's sense of 'one thing being motivated by the other,' and as such is neither organized like nor comprehensive enough to be an a reference for "abstract" algebra. Higher algebraic structures are included and developed largely on the basis of how motivated they are by integers, functions of integers, integer-like properties, and sets of equivalence classes of integers. A section entitled "*A*" is taken to mean "the main theme of this section is *A,*" rather than "this is the full treatment of *A.*"

For a proper reference, try Dummit and Foote's *Abstract Algebra* (3rd edition, 2004), and for a more conventional and less algebraic take on the arc from integer division to quadratic reciprocity, try Burton's *Elementary Number Theory* (7th edition, 2011).
